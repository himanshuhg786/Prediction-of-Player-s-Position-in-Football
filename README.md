# Prediction-of-Players-Position-in-Football
The Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) is a governing body of football
(sometimes, especially in the USA, called soccer). FIFA is also a series of video games developed by
EA Sports which faithfully reproduces the characteristics of real players. FIFA ratings of football
players from the video game can be found at https://sofifa.com/ . Data from this website for 2019
were scrapped and made available at the Kaggle webpage FIFA 20 complete player dataset . We
will use the data to build a predictive model for the evaluation of a player’s position. Subsequently,
we will use the model exploration and explanation methods to better understand the model’s
performance, as well as which variables and how to influence a player’s value.
